 * 	TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit 
 *  but introducing some new functionality that make it more powerful and easier to use.
 * 	It is an open source automated testing framework; where NG of TestNG means Next Generation. 
 *  TestNG is similar to JUnit but it is much more powerful than JUnit but still it’s inspired by JUnit.
 *  It is designed to be better than JUnit, especially when testing integrated classes. 
 *  Pay special thanks to Cedric Beust who is the creator of TestNG.
 * 	TestNG eliminates most of the limitations of the older framework and gives the developer 
 *  the ability to write more flexible and powerful tests with help of easy annotations, grouping, sequencing & parametrizing.
