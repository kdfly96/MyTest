Benefits of TestNG

There are number of benefits but from Selenium perspective, 
major advantages of TestNG are :

    It gives the ability to produce HTML Reports of execution
    Annotations made testers life easy
    Test cases can be Grouped & Prioritized more easily
    Parallel testing is possible
    Generates Logs
    Data Parameterization is possible

Test Case Writing
Writing a test in TestNG is quite simple and basically involves following steps:

Step 1 – Write the business logic of the test

Step 2 – Insert TestNG annotations in the code

Step 3 – Add the information about your test (e.g. the class names, methods names, 
groups names etc…) in a testng.xml file

Step 4 – Run TestNG    





Annotations in TestNG

@BeforeSuite: The annotated method will be run before all tests 
in this suite have run.

@AfterSuite: The annotated method will be run after all tests 
in this suite have run.

@BeforeTest: The annotated method will be run before any test 
method belonging to the classes inside the tag is run.

@AfterTest: The annotated method will be run after all the test 
methods belonging to the classes inside the tag have run.

@BeforeGroups: The list of groups that this configuration method will run before. 
This method is guaranteed to run shortly before the first test 
method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked.

@AfterGroups: The list of groups that this configuration method will run after. 
This method is guaranteed to run shortly after the last test 
method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked.

@BeforeClass: The annotated method will be run before the first test 
method in the current class is invoked.

@AfterClass: The annotated method will be run after all the test 
methods in the current class have been run.

@BeforeMethod: The annotated method will be run before each test method.

@AfterMethod: The annotated method will be run after each test method.

@Test: The annotated method is a part of a test case.
